  <p>
    I am a "doer" â€”  when I see a problem, I strive to find a solution as quickly and as effectively as possible. I approach every job with a critical eye, and I am commited to contributing to a better product from day one.  I am excited to join the field of web development, where I plan to learn, teach, and raise the bar.

    I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp, which is a short and intensive program that taught me the basic skills of web development. I learned languages such as Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and jQuery. However, I also picked up a greater skill: the ability to quickly and efficiently learn a new language in an incredibly short period of time.

    Before Dev Bootcamp, I worked as an Adventure Consultant at O.A.R.S., which is the largest whitewater rafting company in the world. I also have a double major in Environmental Studies and Creative Writing from Emory University.

    In my free time, I volunteer for the local Swing Dance community as an organizer and teacher. I travel nationally for Lindy Hop as a volunteer and staff member for respected dance events such as Lindy Focus and the International Lindy Hop Championships. I also help organize the San Francisco dance event Fog City Stomp.
