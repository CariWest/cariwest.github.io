  <h3>My Mission as a Developer</h3>

  <p>
    I am a "doer" â€”  when I see a problem, I strive to find a solution as quickly and as effectively as possible. I approach every job with a critical eye, and I am commited to contributing to a better product from day one.  I am excited to join the field of web development, where I plan to learn, teach, and raise the bar.

  <h3>Outside of Programming</h3>

  <p>
    In my free time, I am a semi-professional Swing Dancer. I work in the community as an organizer and a teacher, and I travel nationally for Lindy Hop events as a volunteer, staff member, and competitor. I help organize the local San Francisco dance event known as Fog City Stomp.
