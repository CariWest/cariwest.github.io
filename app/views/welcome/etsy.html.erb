          I don't believe expectations should be met; I believe they should be exceeded. I constantly strive to improve myself, because I believe success is measured by positive change rather than achievements.

          Inspiration
        </h4>

        <p>
          I am inspired by my mom. She is an incredible DIY master who can do anything from sewing a quilt to fixing the plumbing. She pushes me to be my best and to constantly work harder than I've ever worked before. She's shown me problems become easy to solve when we can identify the basic need "need." The hard part is finding the "need" in the first place.
