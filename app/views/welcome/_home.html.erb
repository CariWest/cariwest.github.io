      I am a "doer" â€”  when I see a problem, I strive to find a solution as quickly and as effectively as possible. I approach every job with a critical eye, and I am commited to contributing to a better product from day one.  I am excited to join the field of web development, where I plan to learn, teach, and raise the bar.
