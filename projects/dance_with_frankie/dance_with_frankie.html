    <p><span>Welcome to the Savoy Ballroom!</span></p>

    <p>You have been transported back in time to 1935. Your time machine has deposited you on the steps of the Savoy Ballroom, and there's great news - rumor has it that Frankie Manning, founder of Lindy Hop himself, is inside! Alas, the time machine didn't bring your dancing shoes along, and the music isn't playing. You need to solve these problems before you can dance with the legend himself.</p>

    <p>Use the arrow keys to move around the ballroom floor.</p>

    <p>Frankie Manning is often called the Father of Lindy Hop. As a young man, he was a dancer in Whitey's Lindy Hoppers. He's well known for his work in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkthxBsIeGQ">Hellzapoppin</a>, which is a fast-paced and physically intense dance scene. He is credited with creating the first "air-step," which changed partner dancing permanently. He is a legend and an inspiration to many dancers.</p>
