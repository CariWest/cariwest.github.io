        <blog-post>
          <p>I think there are a lot of universalities when attempting to ask a question. Your question should be unambiguous and simple; you should think carefully about the wording; when appropriate, you should examples for clarity. It seems like the coding world has similar opinions about how to formulate a question — but there are still some nuances I hadn't considered before. Here are the three pieces of advice which stood out to me through researching good questions.</p>

          <p><span>Include a Clear Title & Intro to Your Question</span></p>

          <p>I don't think it's possible to understate the importance of a good title and a clear introduction to the question. A good title makes the gist of your question obvious. A good introduction makes your question unambiguous. This is helpful for the people who might answer your question, but it's also helpful for the people who might reference your question in the future.</p>

          <p><span>Include Code Examples — And Make Sure They're Accurate</span></p>

          <p>One of the best ways to get a helpful and accurate answer for your question is to include the code which isn't working correctly. It's particularly helpful if the coding example is short. When including this example, make sure to say "I expect X, but I get Y." This helps your answer be unambiguous (even if the answer is merely that you don't understand how a method works).</p>

          <p><span>Imagine What it Would Be Like to Answer Your Question</span></p>

          <p>One of the most unexpected pieces of advice I read is to imagine what it would be like to answer your own question. Reread it and consider the following: does it make sense? Is your question clear? Do you have all the relevant information? Are there any obvious typos? Imagining the question from this perspective will help anyone who is trying to answer your question. Questions which are easy to be answered are more likely to be answered.</p>

          <p><span>Google First; Ask Later</span></p>

          <p>I have been fortunate so far in that I haven't had to ask a question on Stack Overflow or anything similar. It is not because I've been question-less — there have been plenty of times where I've been stuck. I just tend to Google my question first. I personally believe that the most obnoxious question is one which could have been answered with a little research, often because the question has been asked before.</p>

          <p>One thing I could get better at, though, is asking a question once searching for the answer has failed. I can get sucked into a rabbit hole because I would prefer to solve the question with some research and persistence. Sometimes I could have saved myself incredible headache and frustration if I'd just asked my peers for some help.</p>
