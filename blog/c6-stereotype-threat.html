          <p><span>What is Stereotype Threat?</span></p>
          <p>Stereotype Threat "is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group." In practice, stereotype threat describes the event in which a person underperforms because of a perceived expectation to underperform.</p>

          <p>All humans suffer from stereotype threat at one time or another. Blacks famously experience stereotype when race and intelligence is emphasized on a test. Similarly, women face a stereotype threat when taking math and science tests where gender or intelligence is emphasized before the test. Regardless of intelligence, these groups will often underperform when they fear confirming a negative stereotype.</p>

          <p><span>Stereotype Threat: Women in Coding</span>

          <p>My first attempt at applying to a coding bootcamp was a spectacular failure. I prepared for the test and felt like I understood the material. I was confident. But when I took the test, I began shaking and I couldn't complete the problem. I couldn't think past the first few lines of the problem. Throughout the test, I had some sense that because I was a women and women were no good at programming. When I had submitted my poor joke of a solution, I looked at the test a little longer — and I had a working, respectable solution in about 10 minutes. My heart broke, and I was sure I'd never be accepted to a programming school.</p>

          <p>While I wasn't accepted to that program, I was obviously accepted to Dev Bootcamp a little later — what was different? One key difference was that I didn't feel an overwhelming sense of pressure to be "good at programming" in Dev Bootcamp's application process. They emphasized an understanding of logic, rather than an understanding of programming — and logic is something that I've always been good at.</p>

          <p><span>What can I do about Stereotype Threat?</span></p>

          <p>Looking back, I see that I was almost definitely affected by the Stereotype Threat against women in programming. This also affected me when I was in college, and I declined to major in programming because I knew women were a minority in programming and I felt I would struggle to succeed in the field as a result.</p>

          <p>When I research the topic further, I find it difficult to understand how my coding abilities are affected by the Stereotype Threat that women aren't as good at programming. It is true that men and women think differently, as discussed in <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-mens-brains-are-wired-differently-than-women/">this Scientific American article</a>. According to the article, though, "males may excel at motor skills, while women may be better at integrating analysis and intuitive thinking." While this is a gross over-simplification of how men and women think, it lends to the idea that women should actually be excellent at coding due to their ability to think logically and intuitively. At the very least, I know what skills I would rather have when entering a career in Software Engineering.</p>

          <p>The bad news is that Stereotype Threat will probably continue to affect me, in some form or fashion, throughout my career in programming. The good news is that if I am aware of it, I can reduce its affect on my mental health and my performance.</p>
