          <p><span>"If we all did the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves." - Thomas Edison</span></p>

          <p>As I've been finishing week three of Dev Bootcamp, Edison's wisdom has come to mind more than once. I know it will only get harder from here on out - but in that difficulty, I see so much potential.</p>

          <p><span>My Gregorc Thinking Style: Pros and Cons</span></p>

          <p>As an exercise, DBC has encouraged us to look at our <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> and to consider how our thinking style might be advantageous - and how it might make us struggle even more.</p>

          <p>The Gregorc Thinking Style acknowledges that each person perceives and organizers the world in a different way, and that these thinking styles influence how we act in a learning or working environment. After taking <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">the test</a>, I noticed that I veered strongly towards the "Concrete Sequential" and "Abstract Sequential" styles of thinking (testing at 48 and 40, respectively). When I read the descriptions of these two styles of thinkings, there were a few things which either don't resonate with me or which I've worked to overcome in the past. However, there were significantly more things which jumped out that I really relate to.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Concrete Sequential:</strong> likes order, logical sequence, and following directions; learns best when they have a structured environment and can apply ideas in pragmatic ways; struggles with working in groups, discussions that seem to have no specific point, following incomplete or unclear directions, or working with unpredictable people
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Abstract Sequential:</strong> likes his/her point to be heard and applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems; learns best when they have access to experts or references and when placed in stimulating environments; struggles with being forced to work with those of different views, when there is too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, and with being diplomatic when convincing others
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>Honestly, I see a lot of things in this style of thinking which corresponds to the experience I've had so far at Dev Bootcamp (and which I anticipate for the future as well): for example, I love the specific directions and pragmatism of the work we've done so far. I also think DBC has worked hard to develop the structure of their environment, and they provide ample resources for learning.</p>

          <p>However, I also see things that I anticipate struggling with. In particular, I sometimes struggle working in larger groups (though I have become more adept at working in pairs or small groups). I can also be stubborn when I believe I am right, and I am less than diplomatic in convincing others to follow my lead.</p>

          <p>Finally, I really struggle when I have unclear directions when I'm attempting to solve a problem. I feel more capable of solving the problem to the fullest possible extent, and I actually find creativity within the directions I've been given. This doesn't mean that I'll stop when I've completed the directions - I usually try to find ways to exceed expectations; however, it gives me comfort to know when I have fulfilled those expectations fully.</p>

          <p><span>Using Growth Mindset to overcome my Gregorc Thinking Style weaknesses</span></p>

          <p>I know that one of the things that will help me to be successful at Dev Bootcamp is to maintain a Growth Mindset. A "growth mindset" thrives on challenge; this mind set sees failures as a springboard for growth and for stretching existing abilities (rather than as evidence of failure or inability).</p>

          <p>A common failure when thinking about Grown Mindset, I think, is focusing on this mindset only as it applies to inteligence. It is true that having a Growth Mindset will help me learn better and faster at DBC. Practicing this mindset will help me see each obstacle as a learning experience, and I'll be a better programmer for it. </p>

          <p>However, the Growth Mindset also applies to creative ability and personality. I recognize that I will probably struggle with thinking "outside the box," or with proposing my ideas to a pair diplomatically. But when I encounter these challenges, I resolve to look at them as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and grow as a person. This will also make me a better programmer, because I will be more capable of working on a team. Moreover, it will also improve my ability to interract with my peers outside of a work environment.</p>
