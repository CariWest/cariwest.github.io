  <h1>On Astounding Myself</h1>
  <h2>Maintaining a Growth Mindset</h2>

    <p>My favorite quote is one by Thomas Edison, which declares that "If we all did the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves." As I've been finishing week three of Dev Bootcamp, Edison's wisdom has come to mind more than once. I know it will only get harder from here on out - but in that difficulty, I see so much potential.</p>

    <h3>My Gregorc Thinking Style: Pros and Cons</h3>

    <p>As an exercise, DBC has encouraged us to look at our <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> and to consider how our thinking style might be advantageous - and how it might make us struggle even more.</p>

    <p>The Gregorc Thinking Style acknowledges that each person perceives and organizers the world in a different way, and that these thinking styles influence how we act in a learning or working environment. After taking <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">the test</a>, I noticed that I veered strongly towards the "Concrete Sequential" and "Abstract Sequential" styles of thinking (testing at 48 and 40, respectively). When I read the descriptions of these two styles of thinkings, there were a few things which either don't resonate with me or which I've worked to overcome in the past. However, there were significantly more things which jumped out that I really relate to.
      <ul>
        <li>Concrete Sequential:
          <ul>
            <li>likes order, logical sequence, and following directions</li>
            <li>learns best when they have a structured environment and can apply ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
            <li>struggles with working in groups, discussions that seem to have no specific point, following incomplete or unclear directions, or working with unpredictable people</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Abstract Sequential:
          <ul>
            <li>likes his/her point to be heard and applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
            <li>learns best when they have access to experts or references and when placed in stimulating environments</li>
            <li>struggles with being forced to work with those of different views, when there is too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, and with being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Honestly, I see a lot of things in this style of thinking which corresponds to the experience I've had so far at Dev Bootcamp (and which I anticipate for the future as well): for example, I love the specific directions and pragmatism of the work we've done so far. I also think DBC has worked hard to develop the structure of their environment, and they provide ample resources for learning.</p>

    <p>However, I also see things that I anticipate struggling with. In particular, I sometimes struggle working in larger groups (though I have become more adept at working in pairs or small groups). I can also be stubborn when I believe I am right, and I am less than diplomatic in convincing others to follow my lead.</p>

    <p>Finally, I really struggle when I have unclear directions when I'm attempting to solve a problem. I feel more capable of solving the problem to the fullest possible extent, and I actually find creativity within the directions I've been given. This doesn't mean that I'll stop when I've completed the directions - I usually try to find ways to exceed expectations; however, it gives me comfort to know when I have fulfilled those expectations fully.</p>

    <h3>Using Growth Mindset to overcome my Gregorc Thinking Style weaknesses</h3>

    <p>I know that one of the things that will help me to be successful at Dev Bootcamp is to maintain a Growth Mindset. A "growth mindset" thrives on challenge; this mind set sees failures as a springboard for growth and for stretching existing abilities (rather than as evidence of failure or inability).</p>

    <p>A common failure when thinking about Grown Mindset, I think, is focusing on this mindset only as it applies to inteligence. It is true that having a Growth Mindset will help me learn better and faster at DBC. Practicing this mindset will help me see each obstacle as a learning experience, and I'll be a better programmer for it. </p>

    <p>However, the Growth Mindset also applies to creative ability and personality. I recognize that I will probably struggle with thinking "outside the box," or with proposing my ideas to a pair diplomatically. But when I encounter these challenges, I resolve to look at them as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and grow as a person. This will also make me a better programmer, because I will be more capable of working on a team. Moreover, it will also improve my ability to interract with my peers outside of a work environment.</p>
