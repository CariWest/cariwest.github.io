          <p><span>Understanding Conflict</span></p>
          <p>This week, we've been asked to examine a source of Conflict in our lives in an attempt to better understand the deeper emotions often hidden underneath "angry" and "upset." It is hard for me to talk about conflict, because it is something I actively avoid. Of course, that's a choice I've made over the past few years of my adult life. As a child, I had a hard time managing conflict and I would often end up in terrible fights with my parents.</p>

          <p>One of the most severe conflicts when I was younger was my pickiness over food. I had a very limited palate, and my parents were always concerned for my health. Dinner time was always a stressful time, and I grew up hating new foods of any sort. My parents and I often fought over my limited palate — I understand they were worried for my health, but something in me refused to give in to back down, no matter what technique they tried (which ranged from pleading to bribery to starvation). When my parents brought up my food choices, I often was often overwhelmed with many emotions, but mostly anger and fear.</p>

          <p><span>A Deeper Analysis of Anger and Fear</span></p>

          <p>The fear is the strangest thing, but it's also one of the easiest to explain about how it contributed to the conflict. I was not necessarily picky because I was stubborn — I was picky because I was terrified to try new foods. I would feel an overwhelming sense of pressure when presented with a new food, and panic would rise up inside me. It often made me want to cry or hide under the table. While I am still unsure what caused the panic over trying new foods, I realize that my choice to pick a fight with my parent was a "fight or flight" reaction — I would rather fight them tooth and nail (or starve) than try the new and terrifying food.</p>

          <p>It is more challenging for me to pin down the source of the anger. I think a lot of it stems from my frustration that my parents weren't listeningt o me when I tried to explain why it was so hard for me to try new foods. Of course, I didn't understand it well myself, so I explained it poorly — I didn't recognize the fear I felt when I was asked to try a new food, and it is hard to communicate about something you don't understand. In addition, I felt like my parents didn't respect or try to understand my feelings. I was struggling with this overwhelming panic, but they seemed to think it was a stubborn and petty choice. They seemed to think I could "turn off" my pickiness if I felt like it.</p>

          <p>Over the past 3-4 years, I have struggled to overcome my pickiness. Much of that battle was won when I realized I feared new foods, but I didn't actually dislike most foods that I tried. I learned ways to trick myself into minimizing the pressure and fear. Now, I have a wider palate than my parents, and I rarely feel the fear or panic when trying new foods.</p>

          <p><span>Managing Conflict Today</span></p>

          <p>Today, I'm more apt to recognize when fear or unwelcome pressure cause a fight or flight reaction in my body. As soon as I feel the panic welling up inside me, I try to address the fear and not let it cause a conflict between me and the person with whom I'm interacting.</p>

          <p>I still struggle with managing my conflict, however, when I feel like I'm not being heard. When I don't feel like I'm being heard, the emotion tends to spiral into feeling like my opinion isn't respected or understood, and I tend to become defensive and condescending. When I notice these reactions in myself, I try to calm myself down. I try to adjust my tone of voice, and I try to reduce the physical reactions to my distress: I breathe out deeply, I relax my shoulders, and I try to relax into my chair rather sitting on its edge. As I adjust my physical reactions, I can often feel mind adjusting, and I can speak more clearly and calmly.</p>

          <p>No matter the conflict, I try to analyze both my actions and the actions of the person (or people) with whom I've disagreed. I believe there are always two sides to the story, and it's important to undersatnd both sides to resolve the problem at hand. While it doesn't always work, I can often empathize with my peer's feelings, which helps dissipate the conflicted feelings I have. This also allows me to retool my approach and have a more productive and positive interaction the next time around.</p>

          <p>As I put myself in the other person's shoes, I also try to understand how my reaction contributed to the conflict. When I recognize how I've contributed to a conflict, I always try to apologize for the faults in my actions, and I try to explain how I will act differently in the future. I find that mending fences as soon as possible is an excellent way to avoid conflict in the future, as the current feelings of frustration and/or anger dissipate upon the resolution of an apology.</p>

          <p><span>Conflict: What I've Learned</span></p>

          <p>One thing I've learned from reflecting on conflict this week is that I really try to avoid it. Over the past nine weeks, I've often felt frustrated or upset with other people. However, I've also always tried to see the conflict from their point of view. I recognize that I have so much to learn, and I don't want feelings of frustration or anger to get in the way of my success at Dev Bootcamp.</p>

          <p>Another thing I've learned is that I tend to become frustrated or upset when one of my insecurities is attacked. In this example, I was always insecure about my pickiness, and I would always choose to fight or withdraw if that insecurity was threatened.</p>

          <p>As I go into Dev Bootcamp, I hope I am able to monitor when I feel a rising conflict and analyze the deeper emotions which feed the feelings of frustration and anger. I hope to notice when those feelings stem from my insecurities so that I might better address my emotions. If I always put myself in the other person's shoes, I think I will be able to manage my conflict and be a productive member of the Dev Bootcamp culture.</p>
