        <blog-post>
          <p>Have you seen the video for <a href="http://youtu.be/QrGrOK8oZG8">Too Many Cooks</a>? I recommend that you take a gander. The video goes down a pretty strange rabbit hole towards the middle, but one line stands out to me: "When it comes to the future, there can never be too many cooks." At least, that's the line that came to mind when I saw the title for the first DBC cultural blog.</p>

          <p><span>Shereef's Fireside Chat</span></p>

          <p>As I watched Shereef's Fireside Chat, a few things stood out to me. First and foremost, I came to understand that there are so many people at Dev Bootcamp who are willing and ready to help me succeed. Dev Bootcamp is full of resources to learn to code, to learn how to work in the software engineering work environment, and to maintain a healthy emotional state at the same time. As far as I can tell, Dev Bootcamp is full of cooks who all have a few common goals: to learn, to improve, and to succeed - and to help each other do the same.</p>

          <p>When Shereef talks about fears, I definitely fall into the first category. I recognize that there is a wealth of information to learn over the next few months, and that can be a little intimidating - how will I compare to my peers who already know more than me? How will I manage learning so much material in such a short period of time? But honestly, that is true for the rest of my life - there will always be more to learn than I can possibly imagine, and there will always be someone who knows more.</p>

          <p><span>On the Advantages of Being the Worst</span></p>

          <p>In "The Passionate Programmer," Chad Fowler encourages us to "Always be the worst player in the room." A common misconception is that being the worst player in the room is that you have nothing to contribute - but that is a sad view, because it isn't true. Even the worst player contributes something to the music. When you are the worst player, you have two huge advantages: you have the most to learn, and everyone can teach you something. Being the worst player is instead a position of power, because you have the most opportunity to learn.</p>

          <p>As I begin Phase 0 and learn more about Dev Bootcamp, I am constantly excited by the environment of constant learning. I am so stoked to be the worst cook in the kitchen (or player in the band), because it means I am always in a position to learn. And if I am ever fortunate enough to be a mentor to a fellow cook, I will be honored to pay it forward.</p>
