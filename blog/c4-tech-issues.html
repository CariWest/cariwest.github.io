          <p>Technology is such a rapidly growing field that consumers are always seeking new and better technologies. Unfortunately, the demands for improved technology often exceeds the abilities of the current workforce. While this is excellent job security for those who work in the technology industry, it also comes with a host of problems.</p>

          <p><span>The Imbalance between Quick Releases and Buggy Technology</span></p>

          <p>When there is a high demand for new and improved technology, companies often get sucked into releasing "The Next Big Thing" as soon as possible. This is an unfortunate Catch-22. Code which is released too soon is lambasted for being buggy, while code which is tested thoroughly is either lambasted for being released too slowly or — even worse — the technology is left behind entirely.</p>

          <p>For example, consider Apple Maps. The program was highly anticipated, but its release was less than stellar. The program was so buggy that it caused multiple people to drive across an airport runway while attempting to get to their terminal; others ended up stranded in the middle of an extremely dangerous desert when trying to visit a national park. When Apple Maps failed so completely in its first weeks, many people switched back to Google Maps as quickly as possible. While Apple Maps is less buggy now, it is hard to gain that trust back from the consumers.</p>

          <p><span>Buggy Technology is a Security Risk</p></span>

          <p>If the only problem was an app which didn't quite work, we might be okay. Apps which were better at User Interface would probably rise above the rest, and we'd all learn to manage with the occasional glitch. Unfortunately, buggy technology is also correllated with high security risks. When a piece of technology isn't thoroughly tested, it's easy for hackers to find a backdoor and destroy lives.</p>

          <p>One example that comes to mind is the Cloud. While the Cloud is touted as the ultimate storage repository for consumers, it is also extremely vulnerable to hackers. Even if the Cloud itself were secure, it's impossible to know whether all the technologies which access the Cloud are secure. All a hacker needs to do is find one piece of buggy technology to use, and that person might hae access to all your information stored on the cloud.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, with the high demand from consumers, there are probably more pieces of technology than not which are a high security risk due to insufficient testing of the code.</p>

          <p><span>How do We Balance Timeline vs. Bugs?</span></p>

          <p>You might be tempted to think that we should just tell developers to get better at avoiding bugs in the technology they create. Well, that would be an excellent solution — if it were possible. Unfortunately, humans are prone to errors. It is next to impossible to anticipate all bugs when developing a piece of technology. Otherwise, this would be an easy problem to fix.</p>

          <p>One possible fix to help develop technology quickly while simultaneously catching more errors is to hire more developers. Unfortunately, this is often not the solution: it is expensive to hire more developers, and companies often shy away from that expense.</p>

          <p>Another solution might be for companies to risk the ire of their consumer base by choosing to take more time to develop a piece of technology and test for errors. The issue here is that competing companies will still release similar technology more quickly - and consumers still prefer buggy technology over non-existant techology. Waiting to release until all testing is done risks losing customers to competitors.</p>

          <p>At this time, there is no easy solution to finding the balance between releasing technology quickly and releasing bug-free products. Unfortunately, this means that buggy technology is almost inevitable. This is a little terrifying, because bug-free technology can create more problems than it solves. In attempting to meet the conflicting desires of consumers, the best a company can do is attempt to find a balance between the things which could make code better (hiring more developers, more thorough testing, etc.) and releasing code quickly.</p>

          <p><span>What Does This Mean for Developers?</span></p>

          <p>As an aspiring developer, the preference for technology which is released sooner rather than later worries me. I am a perfectionist, and I would prefer not to release something which is not thoroughly tested. As such, I can only strive to learn to develop less-buggy code as quickly as possible - which, as an added bonus, will make me a strong part of any company's team.</p>

          <p>And as long as there is a demand for new and better technology, I can at least appreciate that I have job security as a result of the current consumer culture.</p>
