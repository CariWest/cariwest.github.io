        <blog-post>
          <p>I've always found it difficult to partner with someone else in a project. When I was in school, partnered projects were always my least favorite, and I was concerned this would be an issue at Dev Bootcamp. However, while it's true that pairing is hard, I've also found it to be one of the most rewarding aspects of Dev Bootcamp thus far.</p>

          <p><span>Pairing is Hard — and Intimidating</span></p>
          <p>There are two aspects I find difficult about pairing: communication of my needs, and management of my own tone.</p>

          <p>Communication is an obvious struggle on many levels. We all pair over the internet, which makes communication more difficult (limited body language, connection troubles, etc). However, it's also inherently difficult to communicate in a new language, which is essentially what we're doing. I sometimes struggle to find words to clearly and concisely communicate my thoughts. I especially struggle with knowing exactly how much to communicate when I'm navigating. For example, can I just say "create a class variable in the initialization method," or do I need to navigate the initialization method line-by-line? It's different with every person. It runs the risk of being condescending if I explain everything to someone who knows what they're doing - but it also runs the risk of being unhelpful or condescending if I assume my pair knows what I mean.</p>

          <p>I am also trying to be especially conscious of my tone when I am pairing. I have always had a tendency to have a condescending tone, especially when I feel like I am right, and sometimes when I am more comfortable with the material. I am trying to remember that pairing is a collaboration, and we should always be discussing. I'm also trying to remember that we are all learning, and I don't always know the answers. Furthermore, adopting a negative tone of voice does only causes stress. I think I have done okay with managing my tone, but I know I've slipped once or twice. This is something I am constantly working on.</p>

          <p>It boils down to the fact that I know I can be abrasive. Pairing worries me because I don't ever want to make my peers uncomfortable or upset with my words and actions — and so I sometimes become anxious about everything I say. I know that pairing is important because it is teaching me to be a better communicator and a better team-player. But I definitely still struggle, and I am worried about the relationship I have with my peers.</p>

          <p><span>Pairing is Enormously Beneficial</span></p>
          <p>Even as I struggle with pairing, I see its enormous benefits. I love the aspect of mutual instruction that is inherent in pairing — I am always exchanging knowledge with my pair. This is especially beneficial because I am an active learner — I solidify my knowledge when I teach, and I learn well when I can apply my newfound knowledge immediately. There have been many times when I learned something from my pair which I was struggling with on my own; the ternary operator comes to mind, which I had almost given up on. Exchanging knowledge comes up often in pairing, and I can see that my comfort with Ruby has skyrocketed as a result. I can't wait until we are pairing on site, because I feel like these scenarios will be even more common.</p>

          <p>There is something immensely satisfying when I solve a problem with another person. While it's always great to finish the problem on my own, there is no one with whom to share the victory. Conversely, there's immediate celebration with my pair when we solve a pesky little problem — and the mutual pat on the back is both rewarding and encouraging.</p>

          <p>Finally, I see that pairing is important for my future career. While I struggled with teamwork in high school and college, I also know that teamwork is a huge part of the career which I am pursuing. To become better at teamwork is to increase my chances for a happy work environment and a successful career. I am grateful to have som much practice in pairing and teamwork at Dev Bootcamp, because I know it will serve me well.</p>

          <p><span>Giving and Receiving Feedback</span></p>
          <p>I think pairing at Dev Bootcamp is so effective because it is closely tied to giving and receiving anonymous feedback. Receiving feedback has really helped me focus inwardly rather than outwardly; it ensures that I'm more focusing to improve my half of a a good working relationship. It also helps me monitor when I am a less-than-excellent pairing partner, which allows me to find and change some of my habits to become a better and more considerate pairing partner.</p>

          <p>As I anticipated, one of the things that has been pointed out is that I take on a negative tone at times with my peer. It was only mentioned once so far, and I'm grateful for the reminder to maintain a kind tone of voice with my pairs at all times. I was also reminded to move more slowly when my pair is more unfamiliar with the material — I sometimes see the solution to a problem quickly, and I sometimes struggle communicating my logic to my pair.</p>

          <p>I also recognize that I need to work on giving A.S.K. feedback (Actioanl, Specific, and Kind). One meta thing about Dev Bootcamp is that we receive feedback on our feedback — for each piece of feedback we write, it is rated by at least four of my peers for its Actionable, Specific, and Kind attributes; it is only passed along to the intended recipient if it rates highly enough on these attributes. While most of my feedback is rated positively, there have been two outliers. These two outliers were rated negatively by at least one person (though the feedback was seen as fine by most people who rated it). I reread these pieces of feedback and I don't see how they are not Actionable, Specific, or Kind - but I think that means I just have more to learn.</p>

          <p><span>The Dynamic of Pairing and Feedback</span></p>
          <p>I don't think that Dev Bootcamp would be the same experience without its emphasis on both peer pairing and exchanging feedback. Peer Pairing creates an environment where everyone learns more quickly and more effectively; the benefits of studying together are immense, and it might be the only way to learn this much material in such a short period of time. Simultaneously, the anonyminity of feedback creates an honest and positive environment for self-improvement, while the emphasis on A.S.K. feedback helps ensure that feedback is positive and avoids being hurtful.</p>

          <p>I think that the combination of these two aspects from the very beginning of Dev Bootcamp really makes it stand apart in the world of software development bootcamps. It creates a feedback loop which emphasizes learning and self-improvement — and I can't imagine how that will change me as a developer and as a person over the next few months.</p>
