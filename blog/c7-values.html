        <blog-post>
          <p>I've had a hard time writing this blog post. The past seven weeks have been a challenge in many ways — but this past week, they've been a challenge for my self-esteem. Every time I think I have a decent grasp on the technical or cultural side of Dev Bootcamp, my footing slips and I realize that my position is quite precarious — and I fear failure. I feel much more like an imposter this week.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, Dev Bootcamp is will-primed to swoop in and potentially boost my self-confidence and maybe get me back on track? The concept we've been asked to think about this week is Self-Affirmation, which is supposed to help counter the Stereotype Threat. When looking through some of the values that DBC listed, many of the values resonated with me that I had a hard time thinking how this would help — it just makes things feel more overwhelming, in many ways. In the end, I had to break the keywords down into categories.</p>

          <p><span>Personal</span></p>
          <p><b>Keywords: Competence, Growth, Order, Personal Development, Quality, Self-Reliance, Self-Respect</b></p>

          <p>When I look at these values, I recognize a lot of the keywords I've used for my growth as a person. Over the past five years, I've always been interested in self-improvement: I love personal challenges like remodeling my RV or conditioning my body to do as many push-ups in a row as I could manage (the most I ever got was 32, though that's declined significantly). I used to complete 7-day challenges on a regular basis, which were short challenges aimed at self-improvement.</p>

          <p>A lot of my personal growth over the past two years has centered around self-reliance. I moved to California from Georgia. I purchased an RV to live in, and I've been working to remodel it over the last year. I have become an independent person, and it's a quality of which I'm fairly proud.</p>

          <p>One of the reasons I am excited about Dev Bootcamp, in fact, is for Personal Development & Growth. This is an environment which encourages self-improvement on a daily basis, both culturally and technically.</p>

          <p><i>Self-Affirmation: At Dev Bootcamp, I will remember that I am more than capable at growing into the person I want to be. I am self-reliant, and I am competent. A challenge is really just a disguise for personal development.</i></p>

          <p><span>Professional</span></p>
          <p><b>Keywords: Autonomy, Competence, Detail-Oriented*, Do-er*, Efficiency, Excellence, Order, Persistence, Personal Development, Quality, Thoroughness*</b></p>

          <p>These values are a little challenging for me, because they also highlight things that make me insecure — I can value order and detail in a way that many people deem unnecessary and even ridiculous.</p>

          <p>However, I've also been recognized for my strengths in this regard. My attention to detail, competence, and thoroughness have served me well at my most recent job, where I managed all the customers in California and Oregon at a large whitewater rafting company. At this job, I was considered a "do-er" — meaning I got things done. I simultaneously valued (and excelled at) both efficient & quality work.</p>

          <p>I think that efficiency and quality are the two most important values to me here. Efficiency is often mistaken as speed, but that's an incorrect assumption — speed is often careless, and carelesness creates a sub-par product. Efficiency highlights a quality of work, competence, and mindfulness of time. It requires an awareness of the Minimum Viable Product, as well as an awareness of the best way to exceed that baseline to put out a high-quality product.</p>

          <p>At least, that's what I believe when I consider the words Efficiency & Quality.</p>

          <p><i>Self-Affirmation: At Dev Bootcamp, I will remember that attention to detail and a high value on order are often strengths rather than weaknesses. I will remember that I am good at producing a quality product in an efficient manner. I will continue to be a do-er in every aspect of my work.</i></p>

          <p><span>Community</span></p>
          <p><b>Keywords: Acceptance*, Community, Excellence, Helping Others, Inclusion*, Movement, Personal Development, Self-respect</b></p>

          <p>I debated on leaving on the values I associated with community. The more I thought about it, though, the more I realized that Dev Bootcamp strongly values community; thus, these keywords are just as important as those which relate to my Personal and Professional self.</p>

          <p>Over the last seven years, community has been one of my strongest motivating factors. I am a semi-professional swing dancer (hence the slightly incongruent inclusion of "movement"), and I draw great pride over my contribution to our amazing dancing community. When I lived in Atlanta, I was recognized for my passion for creating a warm, accepting, and inclusive environment. I have always been dedicated to helping others feel included in the community. I believe that a strong sense of community lends itself to personal development and self-respect — for when I am supported by your friends and family, I am most likely to succeed at my goals and respect myself in the process.</p>

          <p><i>Self-Affirmation: At Dev Bootcamp, I will remember that I am good at helping others and creating community. I will remember that I will get out what I put in to the Dev Bootcamp community - meaning that if I support my peers, I will be supported in return.</i></p>

          <p><span>An Exercise in Underming Insecurities</span></p>
          <p>Right now, self-affirmation seems like a convoluted exercise in undermining our insecurities. I'm not sure I've gone about the task the right way — my insecurities of late make it difficult for me to recognize my strengths as they pertain to my values.</p>

          <p>For now, I think all I need to remember is my favorite quote by Thomas Edison: <b>"If we all did the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves."</b></p>

          <hr>
          <p>*These are keywords I added, because they have meant a lot to me over the past few years.</p>
